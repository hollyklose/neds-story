House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends, who then
aided him in installing Robert Baratheon's true heir, Gendry, to the throne,
overthrowing Joffrey Baratheon, who was actually Jaime Lanister's son.
And then he lived happily ever after...  The Lanisters were fed to the
direwolves, but they disagreed with the direwolves' digestion and were
immediately spit out.

Oh, and before I forget, there was some story about some "zombies" from
the North, but nothing ever really came of that.
